so i wanted a darker backlight options because i use my mac at night and i find it just too damn bright. so I chose to use brightness controller. 
it's like f.lux on crack with the ability to dim your backlight better than ubuntu's.

> sudo apt-get update
> sudo apt-get install brightness-controller

oh, and don't set your controller all the way down. you'll never get it back up unless it's still clicked and you use the up arrow or another monitor.
super simple app.
